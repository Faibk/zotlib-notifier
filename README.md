# Custom ZotLit Notifier Plugin
This is a very simple Zotero 7 plugin which notifies the [ZotLit addon for obsidian](https://github.com/PKM-er/obsidian-zotlit) to refresh its annotation pane.
The original plugin is [not yet adapted](https://zotlit.aidenlx.top/getting-started/basic-usage/annotation-view#follow-zotero-reader) for Zotero 7. 

The original plugin has more capabilities, this is just a hotfix for the refresh and my personal use.
